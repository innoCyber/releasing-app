name/type/short-description

Name: This is the abbreviated name of the developer who has created the branch. This should not be longer than 6 characters and the best practice will be to concatenate part of your first name and last name to avoid cases where 2 or more developers have the same first name

Type: This will depend on the type of work you are doing which can range from hotfixes, bug fixing, feature enhancements, new features, support tasks, version release, experimentation, etc. The proper tags to use for these would be 
1. hot-fix
2. bug
3. feature
4. release
5. support
6. exp

Description: This will be a very short description of the work you are doing which can be no more than 3 words separated by hyphens

Each section is separated by slashes to form the branch name.

For example 

ugoam/support/upgrade-kotlin-version 
pauak/bug/form-submission-crashing
